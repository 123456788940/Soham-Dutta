AutomobileTracking Contract:

Solidity: The contract is written in Solidity, a high-level programming language for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

Ethereum: The contract is intended to be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, so Ethereum is the underlying blockchain technology.

IdentityManagement Contract:

Solidity: This contract is also written in Solidity for Ethereum smart contract development.

Ethereum: The contract is meant to be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

convertTokenContract:

Solidity: The contract is written in Solidity for Ethereum.

Ethereum: It operates on the Ethereum blockchain.

OpenZeppelin: It imports the OpenZeppelin library for ERC-20 token interactions.

colleteralManager Contract:

Solidity: The contract is developed in Solidity.

Ethereum: It's designed to work on the Ethereum blockchain.

AccessControl: It inherits from the AccessControl contract, which is part of the OpenZeppelin library.

crowdfunding Contract:

Solidity: This contract is implemented in Solidity.

Ethereum: It's intended for deployment on the Ethereum blockchain.

cryptographicDex Contract:

Solidity: The contract is written in Solidity.

Ethereum: It operates on the Ethereum blockchain.

Voting Contract:

Solidity: The contract is developed in Solidity.

Ethereum: It's intended to work on the Ethereum blockchain.

votingSystem Contract:

Solidity: This contract is also written in Solidity for Ethereum smart contract development.

Ethereum: It's meant to be deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

Please note that these contracts are written in Solidity and are designed to be deployed and executed on the Ethereum blockchain. They may also interact with other smart contracts, such as the "NuCypher" contract mentioned in the "cryptographicDex Contract." The tech stack for the NuCypher contract would depend on its implementation, which is not visible in the provided code.
